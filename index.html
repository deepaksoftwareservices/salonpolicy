      <h1>Privacy & App Policy</h1>
      <p class="lead">Effective date: <strong>September 15, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>Book My Barber</strong>. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use and protect it, and—importantly—our commitment <strong>not to share your data with third parties</strong>.</p>

      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>Book My Barber is a mobile app that allows customers to find and book barber services. If you need to contact us about this policy, please email <code>deepaksoftware98@gmail.com</code></p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the data needed to operate the app and provide the services you requested. This may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> name, phone number, email (if you choose to provide).</li>
        <li><strong>Booking details:</strong> chosen service(s), date & time, barber/shop location, and notes you submit while booking.</li>
        <li><strong>Device & performance data:</strong> basic usage logs, app errors, and anonymous analytics collected to improve the app (if enabled).</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> profile photo only if you upload one.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your bookings and user account.</li>
        <li>To send confirmations, reminders, and important service messages related to your bookings.</li>
        <li>To improve and maintain the app (bug fixes, performance, feature improvements).</li>
        <li>Only with your explicit consent, to send marketing or promotional messages — you can opt out at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. No third-party sharing</h2>
      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Book My Barber does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal information with third-party companies for marketing or advertising purposes.
      </div>
      <p>We will only disclose your personal information in the limited situations below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you explicitly authorize us to share (for example, sharing a booking with a barber/shop to fulfil the requested service).</li>
        <li>When required by law, court order, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
        <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of the app, our users, or others (only when strictly necessary and allowed by law).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third-party services & integrations</h2>
      <p>The app aims to minimize external integrations. If we add third-party services (for payments, maps, analytics, etc.), we will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notify you in this policy and update the app settings where applicable.</li>
        <li>Only integrate services that meet our security and privacy standards.</li>
        <li>Use minimal data required to enable the feature — and never share data for marketing without your explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the information we hold. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption of sensitive data in transit (HTTPS) and on servers where practical.</li>
        <li>Access controls limiting who in our team can access user data.</li>
        <li>Regular security reviews and updates to reduce risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While we take strong measures to protect data, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. If a breach occurs, we will follow applicable laws and notify affected users where required.</p>

      <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
      <p>We keep personal data only as long as necessary to provide services and meet legal requirements. When data is no longer required, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

      <h2>8. Your rights & choices</h2>
      <p>You may at any time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access or request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate information.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your account and personal data (subject to legal obligations to retain certain records).</li>
        <li>Opt out of promotional communications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <code>deepaksoftware98@gmail.com</code></p>

      <h2>9. Cookies & local storage</h2>
      <p>The app may use small amounts of local storage or cookies (for the web portion) to store preferences and session data. These are not used to build profiles for third-party sharing.</p>

      <h2>10. Children</h2>
      <p>Our services are not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under that age. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us to request deletion.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the Effective Date at the top and, where appropriate, notify users via the app or email. Continued use of the service after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>

      <h2>12. Contact us</h2>
      <p>For questions or requests about this policy, please contact:</p>
      <p><strong>Email:</strong> <code>deepaksoftware98@gmail.com</code><br />
         <strong>Address: </strong> </p>

      <h2>13. Legal disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This policy describes general practices. It does not create legal rights or obligations. For specific legal advice, consider consulting a qualified attorney to ensure compliance with local laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, etc.).</p>
